# Waveform_Generator
This project uses an 8051f120 microcontroller to generate sinusoidal waveforms in the chromatic scale with volume control and multi note functionality. Development board push buttons are used as keys of a piano which generate a sinusoidal tone for any key pressed, allowing for multiple keys to be pressed at once.
